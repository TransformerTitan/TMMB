## 🧠 Overview

Current multimodal AI agents struggle to reason over extended time horizons due to limited memory capabilities. They process inputs in isolation, leading to a loss of contextual understanding over time.

**Temporal Multimodal Memory Banks (TMMB)** addresses this critical limitation. It introduces a novel memory architecture that allows agents to **store**, **consolidate**, and **retrieve** cross-modal experiences over time, enabling robust **temporal reasoning** across vision, audio, and text modalities.

## 📦 Architecture Components

1. **Multimodal Episode Encoder (MEE)**  
   Encodes input streams into unified episodic representations.

2. **Temporal Cross-Modal Indexer (TCMI)**  
   Builds scalable indices for fast, temporally-aware retrieval.

3. **Memory Bank Storage (MBS)**  
   Hierarchical storage with adaptive consolidation mechanisms.

4. **Experience-Guided Retrieval (EGR)**  
   Selects relevant episodes for current context via similarity, temporal relevance, and availability of modalities.
